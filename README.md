![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-beta-red.svg)

This integration is designed to demonstrate how you can query for Polarity tags from within an integration.  Note that the `polarity.js` class here is under construction and will likely change as we continue to evolve how we implement it.  Once complete, the Polarity connector class will be moved to a standalone repo.

Please contact support@polarity.io if you have any questions or are interested in using this integration.
